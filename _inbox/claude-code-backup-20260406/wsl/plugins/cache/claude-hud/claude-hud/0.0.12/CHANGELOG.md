# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude HUD will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.12] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- Chinese (`zh`) HUD labels as an explicit opt-in, while keeping English as the default.
- Guided language selection in `/claude-hud:configure` so users can choose English or Chinese without hand-editing JSON.
- Offline estimated session cost display via `display.showCost` for known Anthropic model families, derived from local transcript token usage only.
- Session token totals, output-style display, git push count threshold coloring, configurable model badge formatting, and a custom model override.
- Git file diff rendering with per-file and total line deltas, plus clickable OSC 8 file links where supported.

### Changed
- Usage display now relies only on Claude Code's official stdin `rate_limits` fields. Background OAuth usage polling, related cache/lock behavior, and credential-derived subscriber plan labels were removed.
- Setup and configure flows now better support simple onboarding: Windows setup prefers Node.js guidance, the GitHub star prompt includes `gh` compatibility guidance, and configure now exposes language as a first-class guided choice.
- Plugin detection, config caching, and transcript-derived activity/session metadata are more robust and better covered by tests.

### Fixed
- Stabilize Claude Code version cache behavior across resolved binary paths and mtimes, fixing Node 20 CI failures.
- Stop guessing auth mode from environment variables alone.
- Preserve task IDs across `TodoWrite`, detect transcript agents recorded as `Agent`, and improve narrow-terminal wrapping including OSC hyperlink width handling.
- Improve macOS memory reporting, config cache invalidation, and fallback rendering when terminal width is unavailable.
- Clarify official usage-data behavior and keep Bedrock/unknown pricing cases hidden rather than showing misleading estimates.

## [0.0.10] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- Configurable HUD color overrides, including named presets, 256-color indices, and hex values.
- `display.customLine` support for a short custom phrase in the HUD.
- New opt-in display toggles for session name, combined context mode (`display.contextValue: "both"`), Claude Code version, and approximate system RAM usage in expanded layout.

### Changed
- Setup and plugin detection now better handle `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, Windows shell quoting, and Bun `--env-file` installs without inheriting project environment files.
- Usage display now prefers Claude Code stdin `rate_limits` data when available, still falls back to the existing OAuth/cache path, and presents weekly-only/free-user usage more cleanly.
- Context percentages and token displays now follow Claude Code's reported context window size, including newer 1M-context sessions, with a lower fallback autocompact estimate that better matches `/context`.
- Usage text output now keeps the last successful values visible while syncing, shows the 7-day reset countdown when applicable, and clarifies that standard proxy environment variables are the supported way to route Anthropic traffic.
- Progress bars and expanded-layout output now adapt more cleanly to narrow terminal widths.

### Fixed
- Setup is more reliable in sessions that previously failed to surface the HUD until Claude Code restarted, and plugin command discovery no longer fails with unknown-skill errors after install.
- Usage handling is more resilient under OAuth token refreshes, proxy tunnels, explicit TLS overrides, zero-byte lock files, stale-cache recovery, and rate-limit edge cases that previously caused repeated `429` or syncing failures.
- Account-scoped credential lookup and plugin selection are more reliable for multi-account setups and multiple installed plugin versions.
- Expanded-layout rendering now preserves speed, duration, extra labels, and weekly-only usage output correctly.
- Tool execution no longer scrolls the terminal to the top, and transcript reparsing now avoids repeatedly caching partial parse results on large histories.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-03-05

### Changed
- Add Usage API timeout override via `CLAUDE_HUD_USAGE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default now 15s).

### Fixed
- Setup instructions now generate shell-safe Windows commands for `win32 + bash` environments (#121, #148).
- Bedrock startup model labels now normalize known model IDs when `model.display_name` is missing (#137).
- Usage API reliability improvements for proxy and OAuth token-refresh edge cases:
  - Respect `HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` with `NO_PROXY` bypass.
  - Preserve usage and plan display when keychain tokens refresh without `subscriptionType` metadata.
  - Reduce false `timeout`/`403` usage warnings in proxied and high-latency environments (#146, #161, #162).
- Render output now preserves regular spaces instead of non-breaking spaces to avoid vertical statusline rendering issues on startup (#142).

---

## [0.0.8] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- Session name display in the statusline (#155).
- `display.contextValue: "remaining"` mode to show remaining context percent (#157).
- Regression tests for `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` path handling, keychain service resolution fallback ordering, and config counter overlap edge cases.

### Changed
- Prefer subscription plan labels over API env-var detection for account type display (#158).
- Usage reset time formatting now switches to days when the reset window is 24h or more (#132).

### Fixed
- Respect `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for HUD config lookup, usage cache, speed cache, and legacy credentials file paths (#126).
- Improve macOS Keychain credential lookup for multi-profile setups by using profile-specific service names with compatibility fallbacks.
- Fix config counting overlap detection so project `.claude` files are still counted when `cwd` is home and user scope is redirected.
- Prevent HUD rows from disappearing in narrow terminals (#159).
- Handle object-based legacy layout values safely during config migration (#144).
- Prevent double-counting user vs project `CLAUDE.md` when `cwd` is home (#141).

### Dependencies
- Bump `@types/node` from `25.2.3` to `25.3.3` (#153).

## [0.0.7] - 2026-02-06

### Changed
- **Redesigned default layout** — clean 2-line display replaces the previous multi-line default
  - Line 1: `[Opus | Max] │ my-project git:(main*)`
  - Line 2: `Context █████░░░░░ 45% │ Usage ██░░░░░░░░ 25% (1h 30m / 5h)`
- Model bracket moved to project line (line 1)
- Context and usage bars combined onto a single line with `│` separator
- Shortened labels: "Context Window" → "Context", "Usage Limits" → "Usage"
- Consistent `dim()` styling on both labels
- All optional features hidden by default: tools, agents, todos, duration, config counts
- Bedrock provider detection (#111)
- Output speed display (#110)
- Token context display option (#108)
- Seven-day usage threshold config (#107)

### Added
- Setup onboarding now offers optional features (tools, agents & todos, session info) before finishing

## [0.0.6] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Expanded multi-line layout mode** - splits the overloaded session line into semantic lines (#76)
  - Identity line: model, plan, context bar, duration
  - Project line: path, git status
  - Environment line: config counts (CLAUDE.md, rules, MCPs, hooks)
  - Usage line: rate limits with reset times
- New config options:
  - `lineLayout`: `'compact'` | `'expanded'` (default: `'expanded'` for new users)
  - `showSeparators`: boolean (orthogonal to layout)
  - `display.usageThreshold`: show usage line only when >= N%
  - `display.environmentThreshold`: show env line only when counts >= N

### Changed
- Default layout is now `expanded` for new installations
- Threshold logic uses `max(5h, 7d)` to ensure high 7-day usage isn't hidden

### Fixed
- Ghost installation detection and cleanup in setup command (#75)

### Migration
- Existing configs with `layout: "default"` automatically migrate to `lineLayout: "compact"`
- Existing configs with `layout: "separators"` migrate to `lineLayout: "compact"` + `showSeparators: true`

## [0.0.5] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- Native context percentage support for Claude Code v2.1.6+
  - Uses `used_percentage` field from stdin when available (accurate, matches `/context`)
  - Automatic fallback to manual calculation for older versions
  - Handles edge cases: NaN, negative values, values >100
- `display.autocompactBuffer` config option (`'enabled'` | `'disabled'`, default: `'enabled'`)
  - `'enabled'`: Shows buffered % (matches `/context` when autocompact ON) - **default**
  - `'disabled'`: Shows raw % (matches `/context` when autocompact OFF)
- EXDEV cross-device error detection for Linux plugin installation (#53)

### Changed
- Context percentage now uses percentage-based buffer (22.5%) instead of hardcoded 45k tokens (#55)
  - Scales correctly for enterprise context windows (>200k)
- Remove automatic PR review workflow (#67)

### Fixed
- Git status: move `--no-optional-locks` to correct position as global git option (#65)
- Prevent stale `index.lock` files during git operations (#63)
- Exclude disabled MCP servers from count (#47)
- Reconvert Date objects when reading from usage API cache (#45)

### Credits
