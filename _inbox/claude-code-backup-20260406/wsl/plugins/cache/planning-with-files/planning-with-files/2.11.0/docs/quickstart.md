# Quick Start Guide

Follow these 5 steps to use the planning-with-files pattern.

---

## Step 1: Invoke the Skill and Describe Your Task

**When:** Before starting any work on a complex task

**Action:** Invoke the skill (e.g., `/plan` or `/planning-with-files:start`) and describe what you want to accomplish. The AI will create all three planning files in your project directory:

- `task_plan.md` — Phases and progress tracking
- `findings.md` — Research and discoveries
- `progress.md` — Session log and test results

If you invoke the skill without a task description, the AI will ask you what you'd like to plan.

**Manual alternative:** If you prefer to create files yourself:
```bash
# Use the init script
./scripts/init-session.sh
# Then fill in the Goal section in task_plan.md
```

---

## Step 2: Plan Your Phases

**When:** Right after creating the files

**Action:** Break your task into 3-7 phases in `task_plan.md`

**Example:**
```markdown
### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
- [ ] Understand user intent
- [ ] Research existing solutions
- **Status:** in_progress

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Write core code
- **Status:** pending
```

**Update:**
- `task_plan.md`: Define your phases
- `progress.md`: Note that planning is complete

## Step 3: Work and Document

**When:** Throughout the task

**Action:** As you work, update files:

| What Happens | Which File to Update | What to Add |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| You research something | `findings.md` | Add to "Research Findings" |
| You view 2 browser/search results | `findings.md` | **MUST update** (2-Action Rule) |
| You make a technical decision | `findings.md` | Add to "Technical Decisions" with rationale |
| You complete a phase | `task_plan.md` | Change status: `in_progress` → `complete` |
| You complete a phase | `progress.md` | Log actions taken, files modified |
| An error occurs | `task_plan.md` | Add to "Errors Encountered" table |
| An error occurs | `progress.md` | Add to "Error Log" with timestamp |

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Research → Update findings.md
2. Research → Update findings.md (2nd time - MUST update now!)
3. Make decision → Update findings.md "Technical Decisions"
4. Implement code → Update progress.md "Actions taken"
5. Complete phase → Update task_plan.md status to "complete"
6. Complete phase → Update progress.md with phase summary
```

## Step 4: Re-read Before Decisions

**When:** Before making major decisions (automatic with hooks in Claude Code)

**Action:** The PreToolUse hook automatically reads `task_plan.md` before Write/Edit/Bash operations

**Manual reminder (if not using hooks):** Before important choices, read `task_plan.md` to refresh your goals

**Why:** After many tool calls, original goals can be forgotten. Re-reading brings them back into attention.

---

## Step 5: Complete and Verify

**When:** When you think the task is done

**Action:** Verify completion:

1. **Check `task_plan.md`**: All phases should have `**Status:** complete`
2. **Check `progress.md`**: All phases should be logged with actions taken
3. **Run completion check** (if using hooks, this happens automatically):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-complete.sh
   ```

**If not complete:** The Stop hook (or script) will prevent stopping. Continue working until all phases are done.

**If complete:** Deliver your work! All three planning files document your process.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Start work without creating `task_plan.md` | Always create the plan file first |
| Forget to update `findings.md` after 2 browser operations | Set a reminder: "2 view/browser ops = update findings.md" |
| Skip logging errors because you fixed them quickly | Log ALL errors, even ones you resolved immediately |
| Repeat the same failed action | If something fails, log it and try a different approach |
| Only update one file | The three files work together - update them as a set |
