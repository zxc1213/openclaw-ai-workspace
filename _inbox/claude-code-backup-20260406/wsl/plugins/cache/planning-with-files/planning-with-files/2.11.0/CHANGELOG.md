## [2.11.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- **`/plan` Command for Easier Autocomplete** (Issue #39)

## [2.4.0] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Fixed SKILL.md frontmatter to comply with official Agent Skills spec** (Issue #39)
  - Removed invalid `hooks:` field from SKILL.md frontmatter (not supported by spec)

- Version now stored in `metadata.version` field
- Removed `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable references from SKILL.md (use relative paths)

### Technical Details

The previous SKILL.md used non-standard frontmatter fields:
```yaml
# OLD (broken)
version: "2.3.0"           # NOT supported at top level
user-invocable: true       # NOT in official spec
hooks:                     # NOT supported in SKILL.md
  PreToolUse: ...
```

Now uses spec-compliant format:
```yaml
# NEW (fixed)
name: planning-with-files
description: ...
license: MIT
metadata:
  version: "2.4.0"
  author: OthmanAdi
allowed-tools: Read Write Edit Bash Glob Grep WebFetch WebSearch
```

After this fix, templates exist in THREE locations for maximum compatibility:
- `templates/` - At repo root (for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/`)
- `planning-with-files/templates/` - For plugin marketplace installs
- `skills/planning-with-files/templates/` - For legacy `~/.claude/skills/` installs

### Workaround for Existing Users

If you still experience issues after updating:
1. Uninstall: `/plugin uninstall planning-with-files@planning-with-files`
2. Reinstall: `/plugin marketplace add OthmanAdi/planning-with-files`
3. Install: `/plugin install planning-with-files@planning-with-files`
